= Introduction =

This page describes the currently available ways of TapMania deployment.

= Details =

Currently the ready to use build is not available. You can checkout the sources using svn as described in the *Source* tab of the project page. You will need to compile the sources manually and deploy the application by hand. I would not suggest to try this unless you are feeling strong in this area.

= Compiling TapMania =

Most of the time TapMania is compatible with both Xcode/Official SDK and the 2.x toolchain under linux (Thank you, Saurik!).

To compile under the official SDK, just use Xcode as usual. Xcode project is available in the root of TapMania's sources tree. Note that you will need to use the *Device/Release* settings to compile for real hardware.

Compilation under the toolchain/linux is done using the *make* command as usual.

= Deployment =

The resulting tm.tar (under linux/toolchain) must be extracted to */Applications/* on the iPhone.

Under the official SDK you will get a *build* directory and there the *Release-iphoneos/TapMania.app* directory which can be copied to */Applications/* on the iPhone.

In both cases you need to do *# ldid -S /Applications/TapMania.app/TapMania* on your iPhone in order to use TapMania. If you don't - the application will fail to launch.

Have fun :-)
