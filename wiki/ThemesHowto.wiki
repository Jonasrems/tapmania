#summary Howto create custom themes and noteskins

= Abstract = 
TapMania supports themes and noteskins at the engine level.
Well, you can't pick one in options at the moment but you definitely can hack around with the default theme.
This page describes exactly how one can do that.

= Themes =
Themes are located in the '/Applications/TapMania.app/themes/' directory.
Currently you can hack around with the default theme which is located in '...themes/default/'. 

The layout of that directory is close to the one used by stepmania. But most important is the *Metrics.plist* file. You can hack it to assign different positions to UI elements in the game.

Ok. There are also a couple of directories there:
- Fonts -- This is not used atm since we use system fonts.
- Sounds -- This is not used atm.. just because I didn't code the engine for that.
- Graphics -- This is used intensively!

As you can understand already.. you are interested in the Graphics folder.
That folder contains images. You must never change filenames here.

= Noteskins =
Noteskins are located in the '/Applications/TapMania.app/noteskins/' directory.
Noteskins can be hacked in the same way as themes can. You are limited to the default noteskin atm. 
The noteskins system is pretty straightforward at the current state so no need to talk about it.

Happy hacking :)
